## Acknowledgement

This app's design is inspired by the work of Omar Sherif. You can view the source design on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/98918603/POMO-UIKIT).

## Introduction

The Pomodoro App is a time management tool built with Flutter. It helps users to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This technique is known as the Pomodoro Technique, which aims to improve focus and productivity.

## Features

- **Splash Screen**: A welcoming splash screen when the app launches.
- **Timer**: Set a Pomodoro timer for work intervals.
- **Pause/Resume**: Ability to pause and resume the timer.
- **Break Periods**: Automatically set breaks after each work interval.
- **Customizable**: Adjust the length of work intervals and breaks.
- **Time Adjustment**: While the timer is working, you can't adjust the time bar, but you can pause and reset the timer.
